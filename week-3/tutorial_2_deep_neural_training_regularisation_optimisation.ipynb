        "In this notebook we will focus on the many techniques which actually get neural networks to run - optimization and regularisation. In the last notebook we focused on quickly getting models whipped up and ready to go for a variety of tasks, data and settings. In this notebook our approach will be quite different, and we will rather focus on working on just one kind of problem, of image classification - by keeping the problem fixed, we can then really focus on what each of the different optimisation and regularisation procedures do.\n",

        "This notebooks features some code and concepts from the UPenn CS-522 course, specifically their [week 4 on Optimisation](https://github.com/CIS-522/course-content/tree/main/tutorials/W04_Optimization), and [week 5 on Regularisation](https://github.com/CIS-522/course-content/tree/main/tutorials/W05_Regularization), and we are grateful for their content and support! We would also highly recommend them as resources for more code and content on optimisation, regularisation, and other content on deep learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Notes about the tutorial**: Much like the last tutorial, there is a lot more code here. Once again, a lot of that code is just to setup data and some of the neural nets, and we have tried to comment the code as extensively as possible. Like last time, we highly recommend looking at the homework at the bottom of the notebook so that you can manage your time on the notebook better. Getting to know about the possible range of optimization options and regularisation options is a very helpful (and necessary) exercise to get the most out of your deep neural models. Throughout this notebook, you will also encounter some exploratory questions. You need not answer them in the notebook but you are encouraged to search for the answers (or ask us if you can't find them!).\n",
        "\n",
        "Your purpose in this notebook is to be able to adapt your Keras or PyTorch models with the various techniques we discuss below. All the primary code in the notebook is in PyTorch with links to resources or documentation for similar options in Keras.\n"

        "Rather than improving the optimization algorithms, batch normalization improves the network structure itself by adding additional layers in between existing layers. The goal is to improve the optimization and generalization performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "In neural networks, we typically alternate linear (weighted summation) operations with non-linear operations, the activation functions, such as ReLU. The most common practice is to put the normalization is between the linear layers and activation functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "More formally, normalization is as follows:\n",
        "$$\\tilde x_j = a\\frac{x_j-\\mu_j}{\\sigma_j}+b$$\n",
        "where\n",
        "*   $x_j$ is the output of a neuron or, equivalently, the input to the next layer,\n",
        "*   $\\tilde x_j$ is that same feature after being normalized ,\n",
        "*   $\\mu_j$ is the mean of the feature $x_j$ over the minibatch,\n",
        "*   $\\sigma_j$ is the estimate of the standard deviation of $x_j$ over the minibatch (with $\\epsilon$ added, so we don't divide by zero),\n",
        "*   $a$ is the learnable scaling factor,\n",
        "*   $b$ is the learnable bias term.\n",
        "\n",
        "Batch normalization tries to reduce the “internal covariate shift” between the training and testing data. Internal covariate shift is the change in the distribution of network activations due to the change in paramaters during training. In neural networks, the output of the first layer feeds into the second layer, the output of the second layer feeds into the third, and so on. When the parameters of a layer change, so does the distribution of inputs to subsequent layers. These shifts in input distributions can be problematic for neural networks, especially deep neural networks that could have a large number of layers. Batch normalization tries to mitigate this. You can check out [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) paper where the idea of mitigating internal covariance shift with batch normalization was first introduced. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The advantages of BN are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Networks with normalization layers are easier to optimize, allowing for the use of larger learning rates, speeding up the training of neural networks.\n",
        "*   The mean/std deviation estimates are noisy due to the randomness of the samples in batch. This extra “noise” sometimes results in better generalization. Normalization has a regularization effect.\n",
        "*   Normalization reduces sensitivity to weight initialization.\n"

        "## Concluding Optimisation\n",
        "\n",
        "So we've seen a bunch of different optimizing methods, Batch Normalisation layers, and annealing methods which control the way the optimisation tapers off. Usually, we focus on optimisation technique and fine tuning after we've decided on the model we want to use on the data, though it is worth keeping an eye on the general optimisation techniques when we are training (such as the kind of optimiser we will be choosing). Optimisation works in tandem with the second set of topics we will be exploring, Regularisation, in part of being the key ways we truly master training a model. Model architecture and deciding the right kind of model for your data is crucial, but optimisation and regularisation is what it make the model ready for production (if that is your goal!).\n",
        "\n",
        "So while optimisation dealt with the way our model back propagates information about changing the model weights based on the predictions, *regularisation* deals with ways we can allow our model to generalise better, and avoid over-fitting our model, and allowing it to be flexible in the way it deals with new data. In the following section, we will deal with multiple ways to regularise our data. We will continue dealing with image based models, but will move to a different dataset which is more complex, of animal faces.\n",
